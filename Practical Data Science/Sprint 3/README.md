# Sprint 3 - Using NLP to predicting the performance of the stock market

##### I use news headlines to predict whether the stock market's performance rose (or stayed the same) or decreased - using NLP techniques and classification models.

To pre-process the text for the models, I use TF-IDF vectoriser in one notebook (labelled NLP Stock Market Prediction - TF-IDF Vectoriser.ipynb) and Word2Vec in the second notebook.
