# Sprint 2 - Data Pre-processing and Exploration: Predicting the functionality of Tanzanian Water Pumps 

In this repo, I show how I pre-processed and explored the data for the Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table competition on Driven Data.
A detailed article about my approach can be found here: https://medium.com/@enahoroprecious/9fb6b15ae6c

Original data: Test Set.csv, Training Data.csv, Training Labels.csv

Processed datasets: new_train.csv, new_test.csv

I worked on this project as part of a team for my coursework. The following articles by my teammates would be helpful in learning about the modelling portion for the competition:
